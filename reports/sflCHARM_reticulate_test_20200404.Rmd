```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup
We need to load some R packages before we can perform our computing.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
```

The shell script to install the packages we need is in `src/install_python_packages_20200403.sh`. This creates a conda environment called `env_sflCHARM` and activates it.

We also have some Python libraries to load.
```{python}
from functools import reduce
from typing import Tuple, Dict, Any
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import altair as alt
```


Now, we want to set our initial parameters.
```{python}

```

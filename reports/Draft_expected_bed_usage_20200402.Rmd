```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Python Setup
We install the R package `reticulate` with the following commands:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("reticulate")
```

**MAKE SURE YOU HAVE NO OTHER INSTANCES OF RSTUDIO OPEN, AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE SAVED ALL OF YOUR WORK.** The first time we load this library, we are asked if we want to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). We say yes. Unfortunately, the install from within RStudio isn't perfect. At the end, you will see the message "Miniconda has been successfully installed at <PATH HERE>". After that, you have to stop RStudio's work by restarting.
```{r}
library(reticulate)
```


We can run Python code with the following:
```{python}
# import numpy as np
print("Hello, World")
```

To hide code and only show output, add the chunk option `echo = FALSE`:
```{python, echo = FALSE}
# import pandas as pd
print(sys.version_info)
```

### Return to R Code
Right now, if we were running this code interactively, then our prompt is a python prompt. We get back to R by calling a code chunk with R again. Also, we could use the python command `quit` (with no parentheses) to escape the python command prompt.
```{r}
"And we're back"
```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Python Setup
We install the R package `reticulate` with the following commands:
```{r}
# install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```

We can run Python code with the following:
```{python}
import numpy as np
print("Hello, World")
```

To hide code and only show output, add the chunk option `echo = FALSE`:
```{python, echo = FALSE}
# import pandas as pd
print(sys.version_info)
```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
